### Free-time projects:

| Project | Comment |
| ------- | --------------|
| [Froth Flotation Video Analytics](https://github.com/Muroger/Froth-flotation-videoanalytics-using-OpenCV) | Using OpenCV analysed video streams of the froth flotation process. Implemented speed, direction and stability calculation. This project is a part of the Nornickel hackathon. |
| [Gesture volume control:](https://github.com/Muroger/Gesture-volume-control) | Implemented hand-gesture computer volume control through web-camera using openCV, mediapipe, alsaaudio. |
| [Visual Embeddings (object re-identification)](https://github.com/Muroger/Visual-embeddings-triplet-reid) | A pytorch implementation of the ‚ÄúIn Defense of the Triple Loss for Person Re-Identification‚Äù paper. ‚ÄúIn-show Clothes Retrieval Benchmark‚Äù dataset was used. |
| [Portrait segmentation-based drawing](https://github.com/Muroger/Segmentation-for-Portrait-Generation) | Implementing portrait drawing of the selfie-image based on different segmentation models(like U2Net and EffNet). Written on PyTorch. |
| [Neural Style Transfer + Telegram Bot](https://github.com/Muroger/Style-Transfer-Telegram-Bot) | Attempt to implement Neural Style Transfer of a painting using PyTorch. Also integrated the algorithm into the telegram bot. |
| [License Plate Detection and Recognition](https://github.com/Muroger/Car-plate-detection-Yolov4-pytorch) | Using Scaled YOLOv4 implemented Car License Plate Detection and plate identification. YoLO network for detection, Tesseract for identification. |
| [DC-GAN Anime faces](https://github.com/Muroger/GAN-experiments) | Some experiments with DC-GANs on Anime faces dataset. Pytorch. |
